READOUTS OF THE MODEL
#####################

(x) GSK3: glycogen synthase kinase 3. Glycogen metabolism + regulation of many cell functions,
including signalling by insulin, growth factors and nutrients, 
and the specification of cell fates during embryonic development. 
Also implicated in the control of cell division, apoptosis and microtubule function.

(x) IkBa : IκBα (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha). 
Key regulator of NFkB pathway (inhibits the NF-κB transcription factor), activated by ubiquitin mediated degradation of IkBa by the proteasome.

( ) ERK : MAPK1/MAPK2??

(x) RPS6: Component of the 40S ribosomal subunit and is therefore thought to be involved in regulating translation.
May play an important role in controlling cell growth and proliferation through the selective translation of 
particular classes of mRNA.

(x) RSKp90 : P90rsk (also called RSK1 or mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 1). 
Phosphorylates a wide range of substrates including ribosomal protein S6.

( ) MEK: Mitogen/Extracellular signal-regulated Kinase. 

(x) SMAD2: Binds the TRE element in the promoter region of many genes that are regulated by TGF-beta and, 
on formation of the SMAD2/SMAD4 complex, activates transcription. May act as a tumor suppressor in colorectal 
carcinoma. Positively regulates PDPK1 kinase activity by stimulating its dissociation from the 14-3-3 protein
YWHAQ which acts as a negative regulator.

(x) cJun: Transcription factor that recognizes and binds to the enhancer heptamer motif 5'-TGA[CG]TCA-3'. 
Promotes activity of NR5A1 when phosphorylated by HIPK3 leading to increased steroidogenic gene expression 
upon cAMP signaling pathway stimulation.

( ) p38 : Four p38 MAP kinases, p38-α (MAPK14), -β (MAPK11), -γ (MAPK12 / ERK6), and -δ (MAPK13 / SAPK4) identified.


( ) JNK

( ) EGFR

( ) PI3K

( ) AKT

( ) mTOR
