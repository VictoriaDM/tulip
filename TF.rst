READOUTS OF THE MODEL
#####################

(x) GSK3: glycogen synthase kinase 3. Glycogen metabolism + regulation of many cell functions,
including signalling by insulin, growth factors and nutrients, 
and the specification of cell fates during embryonic development. 
Also implicated in the control of cell division, apoptosis and microtubule function.

(x) IkBa : IκBα (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha). Key regulator of NFkB pathway, activated by ubiquitin mediated degradation of IkBa by the proteasome.

( ) ERK : MAPK1/MAPK2?

(x) RPS6: Component of the 40S ribosomal subunit and is therefore thought to be involved in regulating translation.
May play an important role in controlling cell growth and proliferation through the selective translation of 
particular classes of mRNA.
