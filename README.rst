todo list
============


* [x] Get data, names of the relevant files
* [x] Use Pandas to read the files and instropect the data
* [x] Plot the IC50 (histogram, 2D plots ...): no need only 1 value used
* [x] identifiy the cell lines 
* [x] identify identifiers of the cell lines
* [x] identifiers of the drug
* [x] identifiy identifers of the targets of interests
* [x] do we have other ICYY ? maybe but private
* [x] write regression algos to identify beta parameters of a linear model
* [x] prototyping with notebook of estimation of beta variation and Y variation in presence of noise on X
* [x] Study of variation of Y and beta as a function of (1) noise level (2) cell lines
* [x] need all JSON of zscores (TC)
* [ ] Look at other regression method
* [ ] Table of Rsquare for the 7 inhibitors for different method e.g. OLS, lasso
* [ ] computeing X given Y and beta keeping first column a unit vector
* [ ] New X ?
* [ ] using simulation, compute R2 as functionn of sigma. Where do real data stands ?
